# Chrome Extensions Privacy Policy
_Effective Date: August 24, 2025_

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your information in relation to your use of my Google Chrome extension(s).

## Information Collection and Storage
My Google Chrome Extensions collect and store user-generated data directly within your Chrome browser's local and synchronized storage. This data includes:
- **Custom Categories**: Categories you create to organize your LinkedIn posts.
- **Categorized LinkedIn Posts**: Information about the LinkedIn posts you choose to categorize, such as their unique identifiers, titles, authors, content snippets, and the categories you assign to them.

This data is stored using the Chrome Storage Sync API, which allows for synchronization across your signed-in Chrome browsers. This data is essential for the core functionality of the extension, enabling you to organize and manage your saved LinkedIn posts.

I do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location. All data collected is non-personally identifiable and is not shared with or sold to any third parties.

## Links to Other Websites
My Google Chrome Extensions may contain links to other websites not operated by me. This Privacy Policy does not cover how that website processes personal information. I encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of every website that you visit.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy, and the "Effective Date" above will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using my Google Chrome Extensions, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using my Google Chrome Extensions.

## Feedback
If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact me by [email](mailto:jatin.g.panjwani@gmail.com).
