# Active Context: LinkedIn Post Organizer

## Current Project State
**Status**: Core functionality implemented and side panel integration complete
**Last Updated**: August 17, 2025
**Current Focus**: Side panel integration and memory bank documentation

## Recent Implementation
The extension has been fully implemented with all core components, and the UI has been migrated from a popup to a side panel:

### Completed Components
1. **Background Script** (`background/background.js`)
   - Service worker with complete storage management
   - Message handling for all CRUD operations
   - Default categories initialization on install
   - **Side Panel Integration**: Added `chrome.action.onClicked` listener to open the side panel and `chrome.sidePanel.setOptions` to enable it on installation.

2. **Content Script** (`content/content.js`) 
   - LinkedIn DOM integration for both saved posts page and main feed
   - Dynamic content loading via MutationObserver
   - Post ID extraction with multiple fallback strategies
   - UI injection for categorization dropdowns and indicators

3. **Side Panel Interface** (`popup/popup.html`, `popup.js`, `popup.css`)
   - Migrated from popup to side panel.
   - Tabbed interface for Posts and Categories management
   - Category filtering and post search functionality
   - Modal for adding new categories with color picker
   - **UI Adjustments**: Removed fixed width/height from `body` in `popup.css` and removed the `<footer>` from `popup.html` for better side panel adaptation.

4. **Storage Utilities** (`utils/storage.js`)
   - Wrapper functions for Chrome storage operations
   - Promise-based API for async operations

5. **Styling** (`content/content.css`, `popup/popup.css`)
   - Non-intrusive LinkedIn integration styles
   - Professional side panel interface design

## Current Technical Patterns
- **Message Passing**: All storage operations go through background script
- **Observer Pattern**: MutationObserver handles LinkedIn's dynamic content
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Adds features without breaking LinkedIn UX
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing DOM elements and edge cases
- **Side Panel API**: Utilizes Chrome's Side Panel API for the main UI.

## Active Architecture Decisions
1. **Post ID Strategy**: Multi-layered approach (data-id → data-urn → content hash)
2. **Storage Model**: Separate categories and posts objects in Chrome sync storage
3. **UI Integration**: Injects into LinkedIn's social action areas
4. **Navigation Handling**: Detects SPA navigation via URL monitoring
5. **Side Panel as Main UI**: Replaced the traditional popup with a persistent side panel for improved user experience.

## Next Steps for Development
1. **Testing Phase**: Load extension and test on LinkedIn (side panel functionality confirmed).
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Verify post ID extraction across different post types  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor impact on LinkedIn page load
4. **User Experience**: Validate categorization workflow feels natural within the side panel.

## Key Implementation Insights
- LinkedIn's infinite scroll requires careful observer setup
- Post elements may not have consistent identifiers
- SPA navigation needs URL change detection
- Chrome sync storage has size limitations to consider
- **Side Panel**: Requires specific `manifest.json` configuration and explicit `chrome.sidePanel.open` and `chrome.sidePanel.setOptions` calls in the background script.

## Development Notes
- Extension ready for manual testing in Chrome Developer Mode
- All required permissions configured in manifest.json
- Default categories (Work, Learning, Inspiration, Networking, Other) pre-configured
- Side panel provides complete category and post management interface

## Potential Enhancements (Future)
- Bulk categorization features
- Export/import functionality  
- Category analytics and insights
- Advanced search with date ranges
- Integration with other productivity tools
