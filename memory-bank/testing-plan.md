# Testing Plan: LinkedIn Post Organizer Chrome Extension

## Overview
Comprehensive testing guide for the LinkedInSaver Chrome extension, covering installation, component testing, integration validation, and edge case scenarios.

## Phase 1: Loading the Extension in Chrome

### Step-by-Step Loading Instructions

1. **Enable Chrome Developer Mode**
   ```
   1. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
   2. Toggle "Developer mode" switch in top-right corner
   3. Verify developer options appear (Load unpacked, Pack extension, etc.)
   ```

2. **Load the LinkedInSaver Extension**
   ```
   1. Click "Load unpacked" button
   2. Navigate to your LinkedInSaver project directory
   3. Select the root folder containing manifest.json
   4. Click "Select Folder" or "Open"
   ```

3. **Verify Extension Loading**
   ```
   ✅ Extension appears in chrome://extensions/ list
   ✅ Shows "LinkedIn Post Organizer" name and version 1.0

   ```

### Troubleshooting Common Loading Issues

**Issue**: "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"
- **Solution**: Ensure manifest.json is in the selected directory root

**Issue**: "Invalid manifest" errors
- **Solution**: Check manifest.json syntax with JSON validator

**Issue**: "Service worker registration failed"
- **Solution**: Verify background/background.js file exists and has no syntax errors

   ```
   ✅ Categorized posts show category badges in main feed
   ✅ Badges match category colors
   ✅ Badges position correctly without layout disruption
   ✅ Only saved posts show category indicators
   ```

### 3.3 SPA Navigation Testing

1. **Test Navigation Between Pages**
   ```
   1. Start on LinkedIn feed

   ```

### 4.2 Performance Monitoring

1. **Page Load Impact Testing**
